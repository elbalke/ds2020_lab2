#How are the ratings distributed? Create both a histogram and a boxplot and describe them. Donâ€™t forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
  Answer: The histogram of the ratings is left-skewed with 4 outliers. Median is 3.25 and the IQR is 0.5. 
```{r}
rate <- choco$Rating
boxplot(rate, horizontal = TRUE, col = "#58FA82")
hist(rate, 
     main = "distribution of ratings",
     xlab = "Rating",
     ylab = "Number of Ratings",
     col = "#58FA82")
summary(rate)
```

How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.
Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar? Create both numerical and graphical summaries, and explain.
  Answer: Between the years 2006 and 2014, there is a steady increase in the number of ratings done every year, peaking over 250 in a year. This is then followed by a period of decline between 2015 and 2019. Year 2020 is not complete. The mean and the median year are both 2014. From this summary, I conclude that the number of ratings does depend on the year because in each year, there is a different number of rating on chocolate bars done.
        Almost all of the ratings done on chocolate bars fall between 60% to 80%. Based on this factor, the ratings do not depend on the coao percentage because the the cocao percentage is merely a characteristic of the chocolate bar and does not determine the number of ratings.
```{r}
hist(choco$Date,
     main = "Distribution of Ratings by Year",
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Number of Ratings",
     col = "#58FA82")
summary(choco$Date)
hist(choco$Cocoa_Percent,
     main = "Distribution of Ratings by Cocao Percentage",
     xlab = "Cocoa Percentage",
     ylab = "Number of Ratings",
     col = "#58FA82")
summary(choco$Cocoa_Percent)
```

How do different characteristics of the chocolate compare? To elaborate, which characteristics tend to be more favorable and which ones are not? Create both numerical and graphical summaries, and explain
