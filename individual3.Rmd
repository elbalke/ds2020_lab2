**1. How are the ratings distributed? Create both a histogram and a boxplot and describe them. Donâ€™t forget to mention outliers, if there are any.**

     Answer: The histogram of the ratings is left-skewed with 4 outliers. Median is 3.25 and the IQR is 0.5. 
```{r}
rate <- choco$Rating
boxplot(rate, horizontal = TRUE, col = "#58FA82")
hist(rate, 
     main = "distribution of ratings",
     xlab = "Rating",
     ylab = "Number of Ratings",
     col = "#58FA82")
summary(rate)
```

**How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.
Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar? Create both numerical and graphical summaries, and explain**

     Answer: Between the years 2006 and 2014, there is a steady increase in the number of ratings done every year, peaking over 250 in a year. This is then followed by a period of decline between 2015 and 2019. Year 2020 is not complete. The mean and the median year are both 2014. From this summary, I conclude that the number of ratings does depend on the year because in each year, there is a different number of rating on chocolate bars done.
     Almost all of the ratings done on chocolate bars fall between 60% to 80%. Based on this factor, the ratings do not depend on the coao percentage because the the cocao percentage is merely a characteristic of the chocolate bar and does not determine the number of ratings.
```{r}
hist(choco$Date,
     main = "Distribution of Ratings by Year",
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Number of Ratings",
     col = "#58FA82")
summary(choco$Date)
hist(choco$Cocoa_Percent,
     main = "Distribution of Ratings by Cocao Percentage",
     xlab = "Cocoa Percentage",
     ylab = "Number of Ratings",
     col = "#58FA82")
summary(choco$Cocoa_Percent)
```

**How do different characteristics of the chocolate compare? To elaborate, which characteristics tend to be more favorable and which ones are not? Create both numerical and graphical summaries, and explain**

     Answer: After selecting characteristics with 30+ points and analyzing the distributions, the characteristic that received the best rating was creamy and cocoa, each with a mean of 3.5. Gritty was the worst with a mean score of less than 3.0.
```{r}
str(choco)
choco$Characteristics1
ch1<- factor(choco$Characteristics1)
str(ch1)
lvl1 <- c('cocoa', 'dry', 'earthy', 'floral', 'fatty', 'gritty', 'intense', 'nutty', 'oily', 'roasty', 'sandy', 'spicy', 'sticky', 'sweet', 'creamy')
character1 <- factor(ch1, levels = lvl1)
table (character1)
boxplot(choco$Rating ~ character1)

lvl2 <- c('gritty', 'dry', 'sandy', 'earthy', 'spicy', 'cocoa', 'creamy')
character2 <-factor(ch1, levels= lvl2)
boxplot(choco$Rating ~ character2,
        main= "Distributions ratings based on Characteristics",
        xlab= "characteristics",
        ylab= "Rating",
        col= "#58FA82")
summary(character2)

```
